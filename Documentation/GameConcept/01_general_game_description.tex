\section{General game description}
\noindent Project-Scopes was meant to be a simple multiplayer game in 2D with the ability to play both via the network and at a single machine. The main inspiration we can find in Curve Fever series and legendary Snake. The aim of the game is to provide fun and excitation of rivalry for the players. The game also helps in relaxing during short breaks of intellectual work. The game offers a very easy to understand rules and easy to learn basic mechanics, which means that it is an "easy to learn, hard to master" type of game. A limitation of the game is the lack of singleplayer mode. However, the side effect is gathering several people close to each other which directly influences on the development of social relationships.
