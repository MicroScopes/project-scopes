\section{Game structure}

\subsection{Game modes}
\noindent Project-Scopes offers two main game modes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[-] \textbf{local mode} - in this mode, players are playing on single machine and using the same controller. Each player is involved in the game in real time and watching the game with exactly the same perspective as others (the image is not splitted).
	\item[-] \textbf{LAN mode} - in this mode player has the ability to connect to the game via the LAN network from a different, separate machine with its own controller and display. Players connected in this way are still participating in the game simultaneously in real time. Image generated for the players is the same, and it is broadcasted on their local displays.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item[-] \textbf{menu screen} - allows to choose a game mode
